- **Affiliations:** IEEE RAS, IEEE CIS, RoboVerse Team

## My Projects

I work on a variety of projects that reflect my curiosity and technical depth. Here are some highlights:

- **Deep Learning for Fruit Classification:**  
  Developed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify and recognize fruits with impressive accuracy.

- **Weather Prediction using CNNs:**  
  Built CNN-based models to analyze images and predict weather patterns.

- **AI-Powered Physics Tutor:**  
  Created an interactive tutor powered by instruction-tuned models that simplifies complex physics concepts.

- **Image Generation with Stable Diffusion:**  
  Explored creative image generation using the Stable Diffusion v1.5 model to produce high-quality visuals from textual prompts.

- **Custom Large Language Models:**  
  Designed and trained bespoke language models aimed at supporting underrepresented Indian languages like Kannada.

- **Fun & Practical Python Projects:**  
  Developed engaging projects such as interactive games (Rock-Paper-Scissors, Hangman, etc.) and utilities like custom QR Code generators and a browser bookmarks manager.

## Experience & Involvement

- **Academic Research:**  
  I am continuously exploring the intersections of AI, robotics, and cognitive science, pushing boundaries with every project.

- **Community & Professional Engagement:**  
  I actively contribute to professional organizations like IEEE RAS and IEEE CIS while being an enthusiastic member of the RoboVerse Team.

- **Hands-On Innovation:**  
  I blend theory with practice, using hardware platforms such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi to bring software ideas to life.
